## Project Structure

When starting a project with FastAPI, it's important to maintain a clean and organized folder structure. Below is a recommended structure that you can follow:

```
my_fastapi_project/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              # Entry point for the FastAPI application
│   ├── routers/             # Sub-modules for different API routes
│   ├── models/              # Database models
│   ├── schemas/             # Pydantic models (data validation)
│   ├── dependencies/        # Dependencies for the application
│   ├── config.py            # Configuration settings
│   └── __init__.py          # Makes 'app' a package
├── tests/
│   ├── test_main.py         # Test cases for the application
├── .env                     # Environment variables
├── .gitignore               # Files and directories to be ignored by Git
├── README.md                # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies
└── setup.py                 # Installation script
```

This structure helps in organizing your FastAPI project efficiently, making it easier to scale and maintain.

## Enum Class in Python

An **`enum`** (short for "enumeration") is a distinct data type consisting of a set of named values called members. In Python, `enum` classes are used to create symbolic names for a set of values, which improves code readability and maintainability.

### Example of an Enum Class:
```python
from enum import Enum

class Status(Enum):
    ACTIVE = 1
    INACTIVE = 2
    PENDING = 3

# Usage
print(Status.ACTIVE)
print(Status.ACTIVE.name)   # Outputs: ACTIVE
print(Status.ACTIVE.value)  # Outputs: 1
```

### Why Use Enum?
- **Readability:** Instead of using magic numbers or strings throughout your code, you use clear, descriptive names.
- **Safety:** Enums prevent accidental assignment of invalid values.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that only valid values are used.

## Pydantic in FastAPI

**Pydantic** is a data validation and settings management library for Python. It uses Python type annotations to validate and parse data. FastAPI heavily relies on Pydantic for defining the shape and format of incoming requests and responses.

### Key Features:
- **Data Validation:** Pydantic automatically validates data types, ensuring that incoming and outgoing data conforms to the expected types.
- **Data Parsing:** Automatically converts data into the correct type (e.g., strings to integers).
- **JSON Serialization:** Simplifies converting Python objects to JSON.

### Example of Using Pydantic with FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: bool = None

@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
```

### Why Use Pydantic?
- **Ease of Use:** Pydantic makes working with data easy and intuitive, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Type Safety:** Ensures that your API contracts are strictly followed.
- **Integration with FastAPI:** Works seamlessly with FastAPI, enabling automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation.
