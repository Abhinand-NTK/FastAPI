## Project Structure

When starting a project with FastAPI, it's important to maintain a clean and organized folder structure. Below is a recommended structure that you can follow:

```
my_fastapi_project/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py              # Entry point for the FastAPI application
│   ├── routers/             # Sub-modules for different API routes
│   ├── models/              # Database models
│   ├── schemas/             # Pydantic models (data validation)
│   ├── dependencies/        # Dependencies for the application
│   ├── config.py            # Configuration settings
│   └── __init__.py          # Makes 'app' a package
├── tests/
│   ├── test_main.py         # Test cases for the application
├── .env                     # Environment variables
├── .gitignore               # Files and directories to be ignored by Git
├── README.md                # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt         # List of dependencies
└── setup.py                 # Installation script
```

This structure helps in organizing your FastAPI project efficiently, making it easier to scale and maintain.
